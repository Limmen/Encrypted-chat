#	Encrypted chat

##What is this?
This is a chat application with sockets in Java, and since this project will be demonstrated in a course on Computer Security i will implement encryption. I will use RSA public-key encryption.

##Current state
Just a simple gui with a local server socket, no clients or encryption implemented yet
